# DuberyMNL Caption Agent — Ops Manual

For RA and Arabelle. This is the human guide to maintaining and updating the caption system.

---

## Brand Rules Quick Reference

### Prices (use exactly these)
| Product | Price | How to frame it |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| Single pair | ₱699 | Always lead with this |
| Bundle (2 pairs) | ₱1,200 | "two pairs" or "share with your buddy" |
| Delivery | ₱100 COD | Never mention this in captions |

### Never Say
- ₱799 or ₱1,300 (total-with-delivery prices — never in captions)
- "Free shipping" / "Nationwide" / "₱499"
- "PM is key" (banned)
- Any sentence that sounds like a press release or marketing agency

### Always Do
- 60% English / 40% Tagalog — English carries structure, Tagalog delivers the punch
- Dynamic length — short when that wins, longer when that wins. Never lock a format.
- Inner arm detail callout — hidden design only visible up close — at least once per vibe
- CTA on its own line before hashtags
- Hashtags: `#DuberyMNL #PolarizedSunglasses #DuberyOptics #CODMetroManila #SameDayDelivery`

## The 5 Vibes

| # | Vibe | Scene | Tone |
|---|------|-------|------|
| 1 | Commuter / Anti-Corporate | EDSA, jeepney, MRT, tricycle, e-bike | Self-aware Filipino humor, relatable pain points |
| 2 | Outdoor / Tactical | Trail, road trip, moto/car/beach camping, running, biking | Active, adventurous, built-for-outdoors |
| 3 | Urban / Streetwear | City daily, sneaker/fit energy, Cubao/BGC/Marikina | Confident, subtle flex, "pa-cool" but grounded |
| 4 | Lifestyle / Culture | Pinoy pride first, Filipino identity, Rasta as one flavor | Warm, proud, culturally grounded |
| 5 | Sale / Urgency | Price-forward, FOMO, "right now" energy | Urgent but not desperate, ₱699 is hero |

## Google Sheets Seed Instructions

Do this once before the first Monday run.

1. Open your Google Sheets spreadsheet (name it **DuberyMNL Content**)
2. Create these tabs exactly:
   - `pending_review`
   - `approved_content`
   - `rejected_content`
   - `product_catalog`

3. In `approved_content`, add these column headers in row 1:
   `Timestamp | Vibe | Model | Caption | Hashtags | Generated_At`

4. In `rejected_content`, same headers:
   `Timestamp | Vibe | Model | Caption | Hashtags | Generated_At`

5. In `pending_review`, add:
   `ID | Vibe | Model | Caption | Hashtags | Generated_At`

6. In `product_catalog`, add:
   `Model | Colors | Drive_File_ID | Vibe`

7. Seed the 11 sample captions above into `approved_content` rows 2–12.
   Use today's date as Timestamp, assign the correct Vibe, "All Models" for Model,
   add the hashtag line, and leave Generated_At blank (manual seed).
